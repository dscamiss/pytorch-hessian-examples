    Observe that f: R^{n x m} x R^n x R^m -> R can be written as

        f(W, b, x) = <1_n, ReLU(W x + b)>,

    where

        * <.,.> is the Euclidean inner product on R^n, and
        * 1_n is the all 1's vector in R^n.

    Applying the Leibniz rule, the first-order total derivative of f at
    (W, b, x) is the map

        df(W, b, x).(W1, b1, x1) = <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) W1 x> +
                                   <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) b1> +
                                   <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) W x1>,

    where

        * z = W x + b, and
        * v (*) w is the Hadamard (elementwise) product of v and w.

    The second-order total derivative of f at (W, b, x) is the map

        d^2 f(W, b, x).((W1, b1, x1), (W2, b2, x2)) =
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W1 x (*) W2 x> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W1 x (*) b2> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W1 x (*) W x2> + <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) W1 x2> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) b1 (*) W2 x> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) b1 (*) b2> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) b1 (*) W x2> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W x1 (*) W2 x> + <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) W2 x1> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W x1 (*) b2> +
            <1_n, ReLU''(z) (*) W x1 (*) W x2>.

    Since ReLU'' = 0 (where it is well-defined), this simplifies to

        d^2 f(W, b, x).((W1, b1, x1), (W2, b2, x2)) =
            <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) (W1 x2)> + <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) (W2 x1)>.

    This implies that

        Hess(f)(W, b, x)
            = [Hess_{W, W} f(#)  Hess_{W, b} f(#)  Hess_{W, x} f(#)]
              [Hess_{b, W} f(#)  Hess_{b, b} f(#)  Hess_{b, x} f(#)]
              [Hess_{x, W} f(#)  Hess_{x, b} f(#)  Hess_{x, x} f(#)]
            = [Z_{nm,nm}           Z_{nm,n}  ReLU'(z) (X) I_m]
              [Z_{n,nm}            Z_{n,n}   Z_{n,m}         ]
              [ReLU'(z)^t (X) I_m  Z_{m,n}   Z_{m,n}         ],

    where

        * # is shorthand for (W, b, x),
        * Z_{k,l} is the k-by-l zero matrix,
        * I_m is the m-by-m identity matrix, and
        * A (X) B is the Kronecker product of A and B.

    For example, Hess_{W, x} f(#) is the nm-by-n matrix M such that

        vec(W)^t M x = <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) (W x)>.

    Using the identity (see, e.g., the Matrix Cookbook)

        vec(A)^t (D (X) B) c = trace(A^t B c D^t)

    we see that

        vec(W)^t [ReLU'(z) (X) I_m] x
            = trace(W I_m x ReLU'(z)')
            = trace(W x ReLU'(z)^t)
            = trace(ReLU'(z)^t W x)
            = <1_n, ReLU'(z) (*) (W x)>,

    so that M = ReLU'(z) (X) I_m.

    By symmetry,

        Hess_{x, W} f(#) = (ReLU'(z) (X) I_m)^t = ReLU'(z)^t (X) I_m.
